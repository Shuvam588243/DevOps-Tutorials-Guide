Lifecycle of a Docker Container

1) Initially, the Docker container will be in the created state.

2) Then the Docker container goes into the running state when the Docker run command is used.

3) The Docker kill command is used to kill an existing Docker container.

4) The Docker pause command is used to pause an existing Docker container.

5) The Docker stop command is used to pause an existing Docker container.

6) The Docker run command is used to put a container back from a stopped state to a running state.
